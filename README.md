## Introduction
* Dental cavity detection is one of the major problem in healthcare sector, which greatly affects oral health and general well-being.
* Traditional diagnostic methods, such as visual inspection and radiography, are often inaccurate, subjective and prone to errors.
* This study explores the use of YOLOv8 and YOLO11, two advanced deep learning models, for detecting and segmenting dental cavities in images.

## Problem Statement
* To develop an efficient and accurate deep learning-based approach for automatic dental cavity detection and segmentation, utilizing pre-trained models to overcome challenges like class imbalance and data similarity in the dental dataset. 

## The objectives are:
* To develop a deep learning-based model for automatic dental cavity detection.
* To improve accuracy and efficiency using instance segmentation and object detection.
* Provide a faster and reliable solution for dental diagnostics.
* Comparing the various YOLO architectures to identify the optimal model.

## Dataset sample images and their annotation file
* Dataset taken from Dentalai Computer Vision Project platform.
* The dataset consists of 2495 images with 28904 labeled objects belonging to 4 different classes including tooth, caries, cavity, and crack. The dataset includes high-resolution images labeled with bounding boxes or polygons to mark presence of these conditions.
